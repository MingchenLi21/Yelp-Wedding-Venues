# Yelp-Wedding-Venues
## This original idea of this web app is from [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). I converted the frontend from EJS to React. The final project with dummy data was deployed and could be accessed at [Heroku](https://yelp-wedding-venues.herokuapp.com/)

## Or use `npm install`, `npm build`, `npm start` to run locally.
